// 5.1 (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers)
//  Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers,
//  determines how many positive and negative values have been read,
//  and computes the total and average of the input values (not counting zeros).
//  Your program ends with the input 0. Display the average as a floating-point number. Here are sample runs:

// Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 â€“1 3 0   
// The number of positives is 3
// The number of negatives is 1
// The total is 5.0 
// The average is 1.25
